# AFIT Swarm Simulation
This repository contains the code for modeling UAV swarms using Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) to connect [Pixhawk](https://pixhawk.org/choice) autopilots to instances of [JSBSim](http://jsbsim.sourceforge.net/).

A Sept 2015 version of the OpenEaagles simulation framework ('OpenEaagles' and 'OpenEaagles3rdParty' directories) is included as well as extension to that framework ('OpenEaaglesSwarmSims') that enables the modeling of UAV swarms.

For the latest OpenEaagles source code, see: [GitHub](https://github.com/doughodson) or [OE](http://www.openeaagles.org/)

The Excel spreadsheet title "UAV_Waypoints.xlsx" generates random swarming UAVs used in the swarmSim project.

### SIMDIS description
_SIMDIS_ with a _DIS_ plugin is used to provide the visual interface for simulations in this project.

SIMDISâ„¢ is a set of software tools that provide two and three-dimensional interactive graphical and video display of live and post processed simulation, test, and operational data. SIMDIS has evolved from a Naval Research Laboratory display tool for the output of missile models to a premier government off the shelf (GOTS) product for advanced situational awareness and visual analysis. Since its inception, the toolkit has experienced significant user base growth with over 16,000 current registrations.

SIMDIS is targeted for Linux and Windows that have hardware accelerated 3D graphics.

### SIMDIS Installation:
Download and install [SIMDIS](https://simdis.nrl.navy.mil)

- Follow installer directions

Download and install DIS plugin
- Download and follow directions in _SIMDIS_DIS_Plugin.pdf_  
  (From the Menu under Downloads\Archives\Plug-ins\DIS\DIS Plug-in Documentation)

### SwarmSim Installation and Setup
1. Install Visual Studio 2013
2. Install SIMDIS
3. Clone or unzip this repository to your computer
4. Double-click on afit-swarm-simulation\OpenEaagles\build\premake\make.bat
5. Open afit-swarm-simulation\OpenEaagles\build\vs2013\oe.sln with VS2013 and built project
  - Right click "Solution 'oe' (15 projects)"
  - Select "Build Solution (F7)"
  - Verified "Build: 15 succeeded, 0 failed, 0 up-to-date, 0 skipped"
  - Close VS2013
6. Open afit-swarm-simulation\OpenEaaglesSwarmSim\build\vs2013\swarmdev.sln with VS2013 and built project
  - Right click "Solution 'swarms' (2 project)"
  - Select "Build Solution (F7)"
  - Verified "Build: 2 succeeded, 0 failed, 0 up-to-date, 0 skipped"
7. You are now ready to simulate UAV swarms using HIL
  - Edit _swarm.epp_ to configure your swarm
  - Run the batch file, _makeEdl.bat_, to compile your inputs into the _swarm.edl_ file
  - Right-click **swarmSim** and select _Set as StartUp Project_ if not already set
  - Press 'F5' or select the _Local Windows Debugger_ play button to run the project
8. View your swarm using SIMDIS
  - Startup SIMDIS and load the DIS plugin if not automatically loaded
  - From the _Plug-in Tools_ menu, select _DIS..._ or press '['
  - Under _Network Settings_, ensure _DIS IP Address_ and _Network Interface_ are both set to 127.0.0.1 and _DIS Port_ is set to 3000
  - Click the 'Connect' button and 'Close'
  - You should not see your swarm and have the ability to interact with it (i.e. zoom, pan, tilt, follow, etc.)
